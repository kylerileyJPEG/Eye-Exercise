# Eye-Exercise
# Description
The "Eye Exercise" is a simple yet fun project that shows the power of JavaScript, HTML, & CSS. Once implemented in the browser, a set of eyes will follow your cursor around the page.
# How to Run
- Fork this exercise to your own Github
- Clone a copy to your IDE of choice
- Drag/open the file labeled "index.html" into your browser/live
- Move mouse/cursor around screen and watch as the pair of eyes track it's movement!

# Roadmap of future improvements
- Use this feature in a future website/portfolio as a fun animation - try to use a version of a logo instead of eyes.
